## Print Instructions

### Staple Stomper

**Quantity Needed: 1**

The part should be oriented such that the hole for the dowel is pointed upwards / text is upright.

Supports are likely needed for under the circular feature for the dowel. I would recommend NOT adding supports into the magnet or staple holes unless you know you need them and can remove them cleanly.

Print in PETG, ASA, ABS, PC, or other material suited for impact resistance and direct sunlight at a minimum of 20% infill.

### Flagpole Cap

**Quantity Needed: 1**

The part should be oriented so that it prints on its tallest axis. It will print better if the serrated feature faces up. No supports should be needed.

### Flagpole Guide

**Quantity Needed: 1 or 2**

The part should be oriented so that it prints on of the two flat faces. It will print better if the serrated feature faces up. No supports should be needed. 

Only 1 piece should be needed, but if you have especially long flags or if the soil is very hard, you may print an additional guide to help with flag placement.

## Assembly Instructions

### Glue-Up

For the Staple Stomper, glue 1x 6 x 2mm magnet in the bottom for holding onto staples as you pull them from the ground.

Glue or place 1x 6 x 10 mm magnet in the dowel hole. When a dowel is installed, it will hold the magnet in if you do not wish to glue it.

For the Flagpole Cap, glue 1x 6 x 10mm in the small diagonal hole on the top of the cap.

For the Flagpole Guide(s), glue 2x 6 x 2mm magnets in the two circular holes within the V.

### Screw-Up

1. Cut the dowel to a comfortable or convenient length for you.

2. Screw the Staple Stomper onto one end of the dowel. Pre-drill the hole if you need to. Don't forget to include the magnet if you wish to include it!

3. Insert a flag into the flag cap. Slide the flag cap on the other end of the dowel, such that the flag base points away from the staple end. Screw the flag cap into place such that 50-75mm (2-3") of the flag is extended past the dowel. This will be your insertion depth.

4. Screw the flagpole guide in at the base of the dowel, with the serrations facing the end of the dowel.


### Configuration

Landscaping flags, staples, and soil conditions will differ, so your mileage with this tool may vary. There are a few easy configuration mods that you could do to make it work better for you.

1. For the flagpole cap, you can add rubber bands in the serrations to decrease the diameter or add grip for the flag material.

2. The flagpole guide could be used in either orientation. You can line the circular hole, or the V guide up to flagpole cap. You can even print more than 1 guide if you find that your soil is especially tough to insert flags into. 

3. Just like the flagpole cap, you can also place rubber bands in the serrations on the flagpole guide. You may have to add a screw above the guide to anchor the rubber band if it is large. This can be used to reduce the diameter, but it also can provide a gripping force for you to grab the fabric of the flag with to pluck it out of the ground.
